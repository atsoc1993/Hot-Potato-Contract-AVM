## The Algo Hot Potato Contract

The AlgoPotato contract is a decentralized game using a verifiable random function where two players participate in a game of "Hot Potato" with an equivalent amount of Algorand Standard Assets or Algoâ€” where the winner receives the full amount and the loser receives nothing.

The contract manages game creation, player deposits, VRF-based randomness, and simulates "Hot Potato" back-and-forth transfers before determining a winner.

## Game Rules:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a425709e-d472-472d-9ba9-b29d86686efe)

- Players deposit an asset (Algo or ASA) to start a game.
- A box is created with player details and asset info.
- The second player joins by depositing the same asset amount.
- A VRF Round is selected 9 rounds into the future
- If no second player joins, the first player can cancel and get their deposit back.
- If the VRF round has exceeded 1,512 rounds since its designation, a VRF round 9 rounds into the future will be reset for the box
- If either player opts out of an ASA that prevents the VRF from starting the game, the reward is dispensed to the player who is still opted in
- If both players are opted out, the game remains "live" until one of the player opts in to receive the reward or both opt in to start the game

## Randomness & VRF Integration:

- The Randomness Beacon (VRF) determines the number of "passes" in the game.
- The output is converted into a uint256, and then to a uint64 after the modulo is taken with the integer 240
- The number 240 was selected as the max amount of inner transactions is 256, and we require at least 14 opup budget calls, 1 VRF call,
and a payment/axfer for dispensing the reward to the winner
